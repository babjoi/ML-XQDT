The XQuery Development Tools (XQDT) provides the necessary tools for writing\
XQuery code. XQDT closely follows the W3C XQuery working group in order to be\
up-to-date to the latest state of the standard recommendations and working\
drafts. XQDT also defines extension points that allow vendors to extend\
the default functionality.\n\
