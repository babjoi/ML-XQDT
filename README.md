Eclipse XQDT Plugin Fork

This project is a clone of the Eclipse XQDT Plugin for doing XQuery development.  This project is to bring the XQDT plugin up to date with the latest version of Eclipse (Currently Luna), and bring the MarkLogic code back up to current.

Note:  All development is being performed on the xquery-dev branch.
