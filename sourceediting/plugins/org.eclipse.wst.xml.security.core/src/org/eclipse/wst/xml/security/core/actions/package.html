<p>This package contains all <b>XML Security Tools</b> actions. All actions are implemented
as background jobs. A <i>normal</i> XML document doesn't need that long to sign or encrypt, but it can
take some time until larger documents are completely processed.</p>

<p>Quick Action classes contain the actions for the quick functions with access to the preference store. User
interaction is minimized for these tasks.</p>
